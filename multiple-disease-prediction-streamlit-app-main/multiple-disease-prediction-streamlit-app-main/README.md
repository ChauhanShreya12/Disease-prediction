# multiple-disease-prediction-streamlit-app
 Here we have made a machine learning disease prediction app where we can predict whether a person is having a particular disease or not by input some values according to the dataset of that particular dataset.
 
This repository contains the codebase for "Multiple Disease Prediction Streamlit App". The training notebooks &amp; the datasets are also provided in the respective folders. 

app.py is the streamlit app code.
run the command "**pip install -r requirements.txt**" to install the required dependencies for the streamlit app.

You may need to install additional libraries for running the jupyter notebooks.
